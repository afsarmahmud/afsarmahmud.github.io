# Research & Projects

My work focuses on **applied mechanical engineering problems** where numerical simulation, design optimization, and manufacturing considerations intersect. My experience spans thermal–fluid systems, computational mechanics, and product-oriented design and manufacturing.

## Thermal Management & Heat Transfer

**Closed-Loop Pulsating Heat Pipe (CLPHP)**  
Conducted a CFD-based investigation of transient multiphase flow and heat transfer characteristics in a closed-loop pulsating heat pipe. The study examined thermal resistance, flow instability, and performance sensitivity under varying operating conditions.  
*Accepted at ICMMPE 2025.*

**Thermal Optimization of Refrigeration Components**  
Performed thermal analysis and geometry optimization of household refrigeration components to improve heat dissipation and energy efficiency. Integrated CFD simulations with experimental observations to guide design refinement.

## Computational Mechanics & Finite Element Analysis

**Structural and Thermo-Mechanical Optimization**  
Applied FEA-based methods to analyze and optimize appliance components under combined mechanical and thermal loading. The work emphasized stress reduction, durability improvement, and material efficiency while satisfying manufacturing constraints.

**Stress-Path–Guided Design Concepts**  
Explored design strategies inspired by stress flow and principal stress line concepts to develop lightweight yet structurally robust components suitable for practical manufacturing.

## Design, Manufacturing & Additive Manufacturing

**Design for Manufacturing (DFM) and DFMEA**  
Applied DFM and DFMEA methodologies during product development to reduce failure risks, improve manufacturability, and support cross-functional coordination among R&D, production, quality, and supply chain teams.

**Additive Manufacturing and Rapid Prototyping**  
Utilized additive manufacturing and rapid prototyping techniques to validate optimized designs, accelerate design iteration, and support functional testing of engineering components.
