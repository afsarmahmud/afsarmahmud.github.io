# Research & Projects

My research focuses on **manufacturing-aware computational engineering**, where numerical simulation, design optimization, and production constraints are treated as a coupled system rather than sequential steps. Through industry-driven research and applied projects, I work at the intersection of **computational mechanics, thermal–fluid systems, topology optimization, and advanced manufacturing**, with the goal of translating simulation-driven insights into **robust, manufacturable engineering solutions**.

## Selected Flagship Projects

### Topology Optimization of Injection-Molded Structural Components for 190L Refrigerator development 
*Lead R&D Engineer — Walton Hi-Tech Industries PLC*

This project involved the complete redesign of a load-bearing refrigerator cabinet base, transitioning from a metallic structure to an injection-molded polymer component. Rather than directly translating the original geometry, the design was re-conceptualized using **stress-path–guided reasoning and topology optimization**, informed by manufacturing constraints inherent to injection molding.

My work integrated **static structural analysis, vibration assessment, and explicit dynamic simulations (drop tests)** to identify critical load paths and failure modes. Design iterations incorporated **DFM and DFMEA considerations**, including rib layout, wall thickness optimization, and moldability constraints. Rapid prototyping through additive manufacturing supported functional validation prior to tooling.

**Outcome:**  
- ~15% reduction in material usage  
- ~50% reduction in process cost  
- Successful qualification through global reliability and drop tests  
- Implementation in mass production

### Multiphysics Optimization of Thermo-Mechanical Appliance Components  
*Industry R&D Project*

In this project, I applied **coupled thermal and structural simulations** to optimize appliance components subjected to combined mechanical loads and thermal gradients. The study focused on understanding how temperature-dependent material behavior and thermal stresses interact with structural performance under operational conditions.

Using **FEA–CFD workflows**, I evaluated geometry, material selection, and boundary conditions to balance stiffness, durability, and thermal response while maintaining manufacturability. Design decisions were validated through iterative simulation and prototype evaluation.

**Outcome:**  
- 12% reduction in component weight  
- 15% improvement in stiffness under service conditions  
- Improved thermal robustness without added material cost

### Lattice-Enabled Design for Additive Manufacturing  
*Design for Additive Manufacturing (DFAM) Study*

This project explored the use of **lattice and architected structures** to enhance mechanical performance and airflow characteristics in additively manufactured components. By integrating **computational design with coupled CFD–FEA analysis**, I investigated how lattice topology influences stiffness, permeability, and thermal-fluid behavior.

The work established **DFAM-oriented design guidelines** and demonstrated how additive manufacturing can be leveraged not only for prototyping, but as a design-enabling manufacturing route when paired with simulation-driven optimization.

## Thermal–Fluid Research

### Transient CFD Analysis of a Closed-Loop Pulsating Heat Pipe (CLPHP)  
*Accepted — ICMMPE 2026*

This research presents a **transient multiphase CFD investigation** of a closed-loop pulsating heat pipe, aimed at understanding the thermo-hydrodynamic mechanisms governing oscillatory heat transfer performance. A **Volume of Fluid (VOF)** framework was implemented to capture vapor–liquid interface dynamics, phase change behavior, and pressure–temperature coupling.

Parametric studies examined the effects of **evaporator heat flux, filling ratio, and condenser temperature** on oscillation stability and thermal resistance. Model validation was performed through sensitivity analysis and comparison with established experimental and numerical literature.

This work strengthened my expertise in **multiphysics modeling, numerical validation, and interpretation of complex transient phenomena**, which directly informs my broader research in coupled thermal–mechanical systems.
