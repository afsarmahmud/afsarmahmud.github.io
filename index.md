**R&D Engineer | Manufacturing-Aware Computational Design | Multiphysics Simulation | Additive Manufacturing | Thermal–Fluid Systems |

I am an R&D Engineer at **Walton Hi-Tech Industries PLC** with over **six years of industry-focused research and development experience** in mechanical engineering. My work centers on **computationally driven design and optimization of engineering components under real manufacturing and operational constraints**, bridging simulation, design, and production.

My research experience spans **computational mechanics, thermal–fluid systems, and multiphysics simulation**, with a strong emphasis on **design for manufacturing (DFM/DFMEA)** and **physics-informed optimization**. Rather than treating simulation and manufacturing as separate stages, my work integrates **FEA- and CFD-based analysis directly into the design decision-making process**, ensuring structural integrity, thermal performance, and manufacturability are addressed simultaneously.

I have led and contributed to projects involving **topology- and stress-path–inspired structural design**, **thermo-mechanical optimization**, and **transient multiphase CFD analysis**, including an **accepted peer-reviewed conference paper on closed-loop pulsating heat pipes (ICMMPE 2026)**. I also actively employ **additive manufacturing and rapid prototyping** to validate optimized designs and accelerate design iteration in industrial R&D workflows.

My long-term research interests lie in **applied, manufacturing-aware computational engineering**, particularly at the intersection of **structural mechanics, thermal–fluid systems, advanced manufacturing, and product development**, with the goal of translating simulation-driven insights into robust, production-ready designs.
