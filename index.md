**R&D Engineer | Thermal–Fluid Systems | Computational Mechanics | Design & Manufacturing | Additive Manufacturing**

I am an R&D Engineer at **Walton Hi-Tech Industries PLC** with over **six years of industry-focused research and development experience** in mechanical engineering. My work spans **thermal–fluid systems**, **computational mechanics**, and **design for manufacturing**, with an emphasis on applying simulation-driven methods to real-world product development.

I have worked extensively with **CFD**, **FEA**, and multiphysics analysis to support thermal optimization, structural integrity, and manufacturability of engineering components. In parallel, I have experience with **additive manufacturing and rapid prototyping** for design validation and iterative development.

My research interests are centered on **applied, industry-integrated engineering problems**, particularly where numerical simulation, design optimization, and manufacturing considerations intersect.
