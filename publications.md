*Transient CFD Analysis of Operational Parameters on a Closed-Loop Pulsating Heat Pipe (CLPHP) Performance.*  
**Accepted**, 3rd International Conference on Mechanical, Manufacturing and Process Engineering (ICMMPE 2026),  
Dhaka University of Engineering & Technology (DUET), Bangladesh.

This study presents a transient multiphase CFD investigation of CLPHP operation using a Volume of Fluid (VOF) framework, examining the effects of heat flux, filling ratio, and condenser temperature on oscillatory flow behavior and thermal performance.
